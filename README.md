## Description
MyNeighbourhood is a neighbourhood app tailored for a specific neighbourhood. Users may take on either of the two user roles, i.e occupant or administrator. The roles of the administrator involve: adding occupants, adding amenities and general oversight of neighbourhood activities. An occupant is able to make a post visible to the neighbourhood and also add a business they think would interest other occupants.
